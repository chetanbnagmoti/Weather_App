# Weather_App

The Weather App is a web application built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. It leverages a third-party OpenWeatherMap API to provide real-time weather information to users.

The frontend of the application is developed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive user interface. The use of Bootstrap facilitates the creation of a mobile-friendly design, allowing users to access the app from various devices.

JavaScript is employed to add interactivity and dynamic functionality to the Weather App. It enables users to search for weather information by location, display current weather conditions, and provide additional details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.

To gather weather data, the app integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API. This API provides access to a vast database of weather information from around the world, offering reliable and up-to-date forecasts.

As the app utilizes a third-party API, it is essential to follow the OpenWeatherMap API guidelines and properly handle API requests and responses. Developers can contribute to enhancing the user interface, adding new features, improving performance, and ensuring code quality.

The Weather App offers a convenient way for users to check weather conditions in different locations, making it useful for planning activities, travel, or staying informed about current weather conditions.
